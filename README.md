Story Pitch

The airline industry is one of the most integral elements of the American economy.
The role of the industry is to provide transportation services to commercial, personal, and governmental personnel.
Two of the most prolific events in the American airline industry were the attacks of September 11th, 2001, and the Covid-19 Pandemic of 2020. The goal of this project is to visualize the effects of Pre and post-9/11 on the airline industry 
and compare this to how the airlines responded when faced with similar restrictive difficulties during the outbreak of the Coronavirus.
This story is compelling through its potential to give insight into how the airline industry in the United States gained resilience or lost strength between the two damaging events.
During the recovery efforts of the post 9/11 airline industry, government funding injected much needed support into the system to attempt 
build american confidence and bolster failing airlines.
during the Pandemic, government spending bills like the CARES act sought to provide smaller amounts of stability through what was considered
a short waiting period between viral spread and the return back to normal. The result of this difference was that post 9/11 injections of capital back into the industry were significantly more profound 
results wise compared to the partisan supported CARES act which was meant to be bridge support.
The data also describes the story of each event and how the industry managed or failed to respond. 
Using Domestic flight data from the years 2000, 2002, 2018, and 2022 this analysis looks at each event singularly before comparing both in a more holistic review.
particular attention will be spent analyzing how the overall industry gained or lost footing (through the number of flights) and how individual routes or airports gained notoriety given the circumstances.

9/11's effect on the American psyche and the airline industry was profound. 
American flights were grounded and the TSA was introduced. These elements meant that the way Americans had freely traveled changed dramatically, scaring away previous customers.
Such a nationwide tragedy also meant that many individuals suffered severe PTSD and trauma when flying, continuing the trend of customers avoiding flight.
Covid-19 had a similar effect on the industry.
Instead of being scared of hijacking, individuals became incredibly afraid of the damaging virus.
Government mandates also halted the booming airline industry, increasing restrictions that were passed on to unhappy customers.

Finding Data
Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
All data was downloaded from published data sets on Kaggle. We got our data from three published data sets, and they can be accessed through the links below.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flashgordon/usa-airport-dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jl8771/2022-us-airlines-domestic-departure-data?select=CompleteData.csv
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018

How was the data collected or generated?
The data was collected from various websites, such as OpenFlights and Bureau of Transportation Statistics, which have huge databases of different traveling mediums in the USA and stores the on-time performance of flights. Numerous CSV files were used to generate the data.

Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
The data on Kaggle was published by Ashish Sharma, Jacky Luo, and Yuanyu Mu. However, the data was collected by Jacob Perkins, as well as agencies such as OpenFlights and Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The data showcases compiled data of US domestic flight take off data, combined with airport data, aircraft data, and present weather data during various time periods, including but not limited to before and after the September 2001 Attacks, as well as before and after the COVID-19 Pandemic.

How many observations (rows) are in your data?

How many features (columns) are in the data?
We are referring to three different CSV files. In the first CSV file that showcases data from 1990 to 2009, there are fifteen columns. In the second CSV file that showcases data in 2018, there are twenty-eight columns. In our final CSV file that showcases data in 2022, there are forty columns. Obviously, we would not be referring to every single column, and will only be referring to those that are relevant to our project.
 

Background Research/Inspiration

Finally, your proposal should include sources of inspiration/background research that you've found on the web. These can be new articles, blog posts, or even interactive visualizations. In your proposal please include the following: 

List no fewer than 5 URLs of articles and other web applications that share common goals and/or features with your proposed project idea.
And for each of the 5 listed inspirations from above, write at least two bullet point items comparing and contrasting your project idea with the given inspiration. 
1. https://www.bts.gov/data-spotlight/twenty-years-later-how-does-post-911-air-travel-compare-disruptions-covid-19 - This source provided signifcant inspiration to the project, but does not go deeper into specific airlines, airports, or longer term trends
2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK578820/ This article is helpful with identifying specific ways the aviation industry combatted the loss of business brough on by COVID and the tactics they used to remain in business and how the tactics used after 9/11 varies. It does not touch on the effects of these events on a psychological level.
3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4440492/ This article goes into detail about the psychological damages that 9/11 left on people. It does not mention COVID.
4. https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/back-to-the-future-airline-sector-poised-for-change-post-covid-19 this article goes into detain about what the aviation industry will look like in the future and data on what types of travel are most likely to resume and not resume following the pandemic. This article does not however connect the effects to 9/11s effect on the industry.
5.https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/488219-lessons-from-9-11-for-the-post-covid-19-airline-industry/ This article goes into detail about the government's role in aiding the aviation industry after 9/11 and COVID-19 and exactly how much money was funded/lost in the aviation industry. This article does not include information on the concerns of airline passengers flying during unprecedented times.
