Story Pitch

Your project proposal will include a "story pitch" or "elevator pitch" where you will briefly describe (~500 words)
A) what is the story you intend to tell/visualize and 
B) why that is an interesting and compelling story. Your pitch should make a clear argument about
why someone would care about your story and why they might find it interesting. 



Finding Data

To start, youâ€™ll need to find a dataset or datasets that are interesting and which you think will provide a fertile bed
for an interesting or even newsworthy visualization-based story. Finding data can be very time consuming, so please start
on this as soon as possible (you might start with https://app.enigma.io/search or http://data.gov). The data can be national
or local, or something else entirely, but try to find something that might have some news value or interest.

Your final project will require you to work with two independent datasets that come from two independent sources.

 

Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data 
(not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

How many observations (rows) are in your data?

How many features (columns) are in the data?
 

Background Research/Inspiration

Finally, your proposal should include sources of inspiration/background research that you've found on the web. These can be new articles, blog posts, or even interactive visualizations. In your proposal please include the following: 

List no fewer than 5 URLs of articles and other web applications that share common goals and/or features with your proposed project idea.
And for each of the 5 listed inspirations from above, write at least two bullet point items comparing and contrasting your project idea with the given inspiration.
