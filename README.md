Story Pitch

Your project proposal will include a "story pitch" or "elevator pitch" 
where you will briefly describe (~500 words)
A) what is the story you intend to tell/visualize and 
B) why that is an interesting and compelling story. Your pitch should make a clear 
argument aboutnwhy someone would care about your story and why they might find it
interesting.

How was the data collected or generated?

Make sure to explain who collected the data 
(not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?


How many observations (rows) are in your data?
